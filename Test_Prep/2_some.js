// Read First: This challenge is open ended. Focus hard on the directions. No two coders will write the same callbacks or HOF. 
// Stay focused on the direction AND write enough test cases that you can feel with certainty that your logic is perfect. 

// Create two functions that will be utilized as callbacks.
// These callbacks will take in a single parameter (a number) and return a boolean. (Think comparison
// between the parameter and something else that is up to you...)

// Create a single HOF function that takes in array of numbers and two callbacks.
// In invoking this HOF function write logic that loops over the arrays of numbers and executes 
// the callback on each element. If SOME of the numbers pass the 'test' of both callbacks this function will
// return true. If NONE or ALL of the numbers pass the test of both callbacks this function will return false.
