Repository for JS Basics

## To Begin:
- Fork this repository
- Code and push to github in order to recieve git credit. 

### Executing (or running) Your Code:
- As you code in this files, picking up the basics of JS, you will need to be executing your files in order to see your progress, complete the challenges and find bugs. You do this by taking note of the file path of the given file you want to execute. If you are in the same directory you run `node name-of-file.js` from within the terminal. This command calls upon the node software package (a JS runtime engine) to execute the file. You 'screen' will be the terminal. It's where outputs like console.log() will print to. 
- If you are not in the directory of the file you may `cd` into it and follow the previous example... or traverse the files path in the terminal command like so: `node folderOne/folderTwo/deeplyNestedFolder/name-of-file.js`. This will not change your `pwd`, but allow you to execute a file that exists in nested folders. 
- Please Note: It is possible to invoke an infinite loop in which if you are printing things to the console you will see copious outputs and if you are not you will soon hear your fans come on your computer will eventually shut down. (Don't panic I know of newbie devs that had an infinite loop running for 7-15 minutes). You exit an infinite loop, thus killing your program by typing `Control-C` in the terminal.
